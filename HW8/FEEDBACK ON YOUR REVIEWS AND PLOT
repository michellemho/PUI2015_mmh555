very good job on the reviews! 10/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

the histograms with the horizontal display highlight the difference between man and women naturally

the colors are compliant with most color-blindness prescriptions and avoiding a red-based color for women is wise, as plotting man and women with blue-pink triggers preconceptions

the two plots should be included in the same panel to allow comparison

the y label "observations" is inaccurate and non informative



NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===========================================


fanshi118
============

good plot, good choice of BW and mean/median in read that highlights it. 

consider using a larger unit on the y axis (miles?)


cindyliu686
============

the colors are not explained nor is the transparency

for the large numbers on x and y axis a more concise notation should be chosen

the 3d dimension is unnecessary and possibly redundant with the color. 

the 3d dimension makes the readability of the Square footage and of the # of units hard to read away from the edges of the respective axis ranges



bonanyuan
============

while the plot is pretty it is very confusing. 

the 3D does not add any information: the third axis is redundant with the blue shade. 

the axis labels are too small (and one is cut) 

the yield value for a single year cannot be read easily away from the 0 ad 30 year points. 

the structure of the data hides some datapoints (obstruction) compromising clarity and possibly honesty
