# PUI2015_mmh555
These are my first plots for HW 8.
I started HW8 before reading the actual assignment. In my mind, the assignment
was "make an interesting plot of whatever you wish" but, in reality, the assignment was
"choose to plot anything you wish, from the data we used so far." Of course, I chose different data.

I made plots based on NYC marathon data. I wanted to compare the distribution of finishing times between men and women.
I used 2015 and 2014 finishing times for the fastest 100 men and women.
