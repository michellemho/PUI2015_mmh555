##Foreclosure Plot

Comments: This plot is difficult to read. There seem to be three variables: number of units, miles from LA city hall, and month. However, the decision to plot a three-dimensional space makes the graph impossible to read. The choice of blue dots that are connected by a line is a strange choice. I am guessing that the line indicates movement over time, but it is nearly impossible to distinguish because the dots are so tightly clustered. Moreover, there is overlap on the labels which makes the labeling difficult to read. Two axises are also cut off (the corner "closest" to the viewer). I do notice one potentially interesting spike in the graph, in which foreclosures jump over 200. However, it is impossible to see where (how far from City Hall) and when (what month of 2014) this occured.

## Apartments

Comments: This graph is lacking a title and a legend describing what the different colors mean. Generally, I feel it is a bad choice to render a scatterplot in three-dimensions. There is a green point on the right side which is floating in space. I have no idea what plane it is lying or what its values possibly could be. I also notice there is different shading for the colored points, and I'm not sure what that could mean because there is no legend. I am guessing it may be trying to indicate the "depth" of where the point falls in the three-dimensional space, but I may be wrong. Points are also very clustered, making it difficult to tell how many dots there are total, especially for the blue dots.

## US Treasury

I think this graph has potential, but it is still difficult to read. The title and labels could be more clear in describing the US Treasury variables. Is the yield in percentages points? Is maturity in years? There is also no indication about what the color gradient means. It appears to be redundant to maturity. Of the three graphs I evaluated, this is graph is the most clear. However, I would still caution against a three-dimensional graph. There is a "dip" in the values that is hidden behind more recent values. Perhaps adding transparency to the graph.
